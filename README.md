# JWebhook
 JWebhook is a super simple utility for sending discord webhooks. Based on "java-discord-webhook" by hakan-krgn

This is an experimental project to see how to publish a public dependency in jitpack. It doesn't and won't work, I don't think it will fix it anytime soon. I repeat that this is just an EXPERIMENT to learn how to publish things with jitpack.
